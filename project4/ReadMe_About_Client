Example Usage of client:

$bin/client.py 'kv/insert?key=hello&value=world'
127.0.0.2 {"success":"true"}
$bin/client.py 'kvman/countkey?session=71397af72e530'
127.0.0.1 {"result":"5"}

Notice that kvman/shutdown really shutdowns the server. That is, you should never
expect to interact with it anymore.

The HTTP server accepts a session id. These ids MUST be different for each request.
If no session id is provided, and you lose the response, you will never know whether
the operation is actually conducted. Otherwise, the operation with same session id
is idempotent.
